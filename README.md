# OREO-robot_dog
Oreo is a small 3D-printed robot dog powered by an ESP32 and lightweight servo legs. Its compact body, strong joints, and simple two-servo leg design give it smooth, stable movement. With a clean internal layout for the battery and PCB, Oreo is built for easy assembly, testing, and fun robotics experiments.
